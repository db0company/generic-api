Generic API
===========

The simplest way to create RESTful APIs using PHP, with an automatic documentation.

Create your own API
-------------------

- Copy `conf.php.template` to `conf.php` and edit it to use your own settings
- Edit the `methods.php` file to describe your methods using the format in comments
- Done!

Notes
-----

- If you're not using the PDO mySQL database in the `mysql.php`, you don't need to fill the `$conf['sql']` arguments
